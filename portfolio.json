      "highlights": [
        "Engineered RESTful API to process free-text user inputs and deliver summarized, structured responses, enhancing data quality and consistency for downstream processing, achieving <2-second response time per API interaction and ensuring real-time user experience.",
        "Leveraged Langchain framework to orchestrate OpenAI-4o LLM integration, enabling intelligent context summarization and natural language understanding from unstructured user inputs, supporting >5,000 Good Saves per month adoption rate through improved user accessibility.",
        "Implemented Guardrail AI validation pipeline to ensure AI safety through multi-layer content filtering, mitigating risks of hallucinations, bias, and toxic content generation in LLM responses, maintaining <5% data error rate through chatbot-driven validation and quality checks.",
        "Developed robust audit system using FastAPI and SQLAlchemy ORM, implementing Pydantic models for type-safe serialization/deserialization of conversation histories, ensuring compliance and traceability requirements while contributing to ~70% reduction in license-related costs by eliminating dependency on traditional form-based systems.",
        "Integrated submission API with Internal System to automate Good Save record Draft creation, streamlining SME review and reducing manual data entry overhead, achieving 90% successful API submission rate for seamless data flow to backend systems."
