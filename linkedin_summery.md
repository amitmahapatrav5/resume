I am a Software Engineer with 5+ years of experience in building AI-driven solutions, specializing in Generative AI, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and scalable backend systems. My expertise spans "LangChain", "LangGraph", "Guardrails AI", and the emerging "Model Context Protocol (MCP)" for orchestrating intelligent, context-aware applications.

I have hands-on experience designing "modular RAG pipelines", leveraging "document loaders, text splitters, embeddings (Hugging Face), and vector stores (ChromaDB, FAISS)" to deliver grounded, reliable responses. I am passionate about "Agentic AI architectures" and integrating LLMs with robust safety validation frameworks to ensure compliance and trustworthiness.

On the backend, I develop "secure, high-performance APIs" using "FastAPI", "SQLAlchemy", and "OAuth 2.0", with strong focus on maintainability, structured logging, and enterprise-grade security. 

Additionally, I have a solid foundation in "PyTorch" for deep learning, including "Tensors, Autograd, Datasets, Dataloaders, and optimizers".

While my primary focus is AI and backend systems, I also have working knowledge of "React fundamentals", including component design, state management, and Context API.
